A Full-stack application built with Node.js, MongoDB, Express and EJS.
Uses MVC file structure: 
Models:  Associated One to many
 album (artist, title)
 seller (name, albums) 
Views: Different views to create, show, delete, update a database of sellers and albums.
Controllers: Controllers for both album and seller to setup routing.

User Stories:
1.  As a seller, I want to list my available records, so that I could sell them.
2.  As a seller, I want to be able to update and delete records Ive added, so I can keep the inventory accurate. 
3.  As a seller, I want to be able to show my entire collection, so buyers can see my entire inventory.   
4.  As a seller, I want the ability to document the name and artist of the record. 
5.  As a seller, I want to assign myself my own username so I can remember it. 

6.  As a visitor, I want to be able to see what albums a seller has so that I could see the seller's entire collection.
7.  As a visitor, I want the ability to see a list of albums and associated sellers.
8.  As a user, I want to see all the albums associated with a seller.
9. *As a buyer, I want to view feedback left by other buyers, so that I know if the seller is reputable. 
10.*As a buyer, I want the ability to add myself as a buyer so that I could make purchases from the site.    

Future Goals
1.  As a buyer, I want to see feedback left by other buyers, so that I know if the seller is reputable.
2.  As a buyer, I want the ability to add myself as a buyer, so that I could make purchases from the site.
3.  As a buyer, I want to see the prices for each record, so that I could budget records.
4.  As a buyer, I want to see a list of different sellers at once, so that I can view inventory from different sellers simultaneously. 

Inspiration:
The idea came from my experience as an Ebay marketplace seller of Vintage Records.  The store specialized in classic Jazz albums.  Surprisengly, I sent more Jazz records overseas then in the USA.  

Unsolved Problems:
Becuase of time limits, I had to keep adjusting the user stories and to what was more feasable.  My earlier ambitions for the project are documented in the "Future Goals" section

Stretch Goals
Was able to use EJS partials to call for data (<% %>)for some of the files rendering information for the views such as.
